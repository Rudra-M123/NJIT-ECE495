# Two's Complement Adder/Subtractor with Overflow Detection
Made in Computer Engineering Design Lab with Dr Hou (Lab6 ECE-495, 2024F)

## How to Use
Here's how to create the several projects you can make using these files:

### 4-Bit Ripple Adder
1) Make a new project with `full_adder.vhd` and `p_adder.vhd`
2) Include `ripple_4bit.vhd` in the project and make it the top-level file
3) Assign pins and synthesize onto an FPGA board

### 8-Bit Ripple Adder
1) Make a new project with `full_adder.vhd` and `p_adder.vhd`
2) Include `ripple_8bit.vhd` in the project and make it the top-level file
3) Assign pins and synthesize onto an FPGA board

### 8-Bit Ripple Adder/Subtractor with Overflow Detection
1) Make a new project with `full_adder.vhd`, `p_adder.vhd`, `tc_add_sub.vhd`
2) Include `full_circuit.vhd` in the project and make it the top-level file
3) Assign pins and synthesize onto an FPGA board
